# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
That was rough. I struggled with understanding this. I think part of the problem is not figuring out how to check the work.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Good. i am making sure to take breaks when needed.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
To ean on the group if I need help.
